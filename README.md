PyPiano
=======
Play the piano on your computer keyboard!

## What is this package used for?

Only for your enjoyment... Between 2 coding sessions, try to relax by frenetically typing on your computer and doing music.

## Installation

Python package with PyPi in the future...
For the moment:

* Requirements:

Pygame 

Python 3.x

## Using it:

`python python_keyboardpiano.py`

You can type using a AZERTY keyboard.
The name of the key to type are indicated bellow the key itself (with the music note)
For QWERTY keyboard, I will implement that if there are people interested with this project (not difficult)

## Known Bugs:

After some times, the sound seems stop! You can always type on your keyboard but without effects and can't close the program!

I'm trying to solve it...

## Contributors

If you have some suggestions, critics, problems to make it work in your special configuration, I can (or try..) help!
