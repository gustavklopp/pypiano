## What is this package used for?

Only for your enjoyment... Between 2 coding sessions, try to relax by frenetically typing on your computer and doing music.

## Installation

Python package with PyPi in the future...
For the moment:

* Requirements:

Pygame 

Python 3.x, but Python 2.x should work also

## Using it:

`python pypiano.py`

You can also type using a AZERTY keyboard: 
`python pypiano.py azerty` 

(QWERTY is default so the automatic value is `python pypiano.py QWERTY`).
The name of the key to type are indicated bellow the key itself (with the music note)

Position of the 48 keys (4 octaves available, from First note C of 2nd octave:C2 to last note of 5th octave: B5)
